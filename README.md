# Target-s-game
a single player game in 2d

Hi everyone !

Today I show you an new game that I made. The game concept's already exists, you have to shot the targets who spawn randomly. I got some problems with the hit boxes targets so you can't see your score at the end of the game. I'd like apologize for the code's language. I didn't know that I will publish my code on GitHub so the code is in french.
Do not hesitate to check my code and try to run it, I work with python 3.9.5 on Windows and Thonny Python IDLE on rpi4, my pygame's version is the 2.0.1.

Goodbye !
